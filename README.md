# Divorce Case Orchestration Service

This application orchestrates a workflow based on the requested business requirement.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/java)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

### Building

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as a build tool but you don't have to install it locally since there is a
`./gradlew` wrapper script.

To build project please execute the following command:

```bash
    ./gradlew build
```

### Running

First you need to create distribution by executing following command:

```bash
    ./gradlew installDist
```

When the distribution has been created in `build/install/div-document-generator` directory,
you can run the application by executing following command:

```bash
    docker-compose up
```

As a result the following container(s) will get created and started:
 - long living container for API application exposing port `4008`

### API documentation

API documentation is provided with Swagger:
 - `http://localhost:4008/swagger-ui.html` - UI to interact with the API resources

```bash
    ./gradlew test
