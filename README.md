# Divorce Case Orchestration Service

This application orchestrates a workflow based on the requested business requirement.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/java)

### Building

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as a build tool but you don't have to install it locally since there is a
`./gradlew` wrapper script.

To build project please execute the following command:

```bash
    ./gradlew build
```

To get the project to build in IntelliJ IDEA, you have to:

 - Install the Lombok plugin: Preferences -> Plugins
 - Enable Annotation Processing: Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Annotation Processors

### Running

You can run the application by executing following command:

```bash
    ./gradlew bootRun
```

The application will start locally on `http://localhost:4012`

### API documentation

API documentation is provided with Swagger:
 - `http://localhost:4012/swagger-ui.html` - UI to interact with the API resources

## Developing

### Unit tests

To run all unit tests please execute following command:

```bash
    ./gradlew test
```

### Coding style tests

```bash
    ./gradlew check
```

### Mutation tests

```
./gradlew pitest

```

### Integration tests

To run all integration tests locally:

* Make a copy of `src/main/resources/example-application-aat.yaml` as `src/main/resources/application-aat.yaml`
* Make a copy of `src/integrationTest/resources/example-application-local.properties` as `src/integrationTest/resources/application-local.properties`
* Replace the `replace_me` secrets in the _newly created_ files. You can get the values from SCM and Azure secrets key vault (the new files are in .gitignore and should ***not*** be committed to git)

* Start the test with AAT config using `./gradlew clean functional`
